The personal maintenance system I have developed is focused on daily upkeep tasks, including adding required documents, pictures, notes, work time, and gym activities. It has been built using MySQL for the database management and HTML and CSS for the front-end interface.

To begin, the system's database design involves identifying the entities to be tracked, such as documents, pictures, notes, work time, and gym activities. Next, attributes are defined for each entity, taking into account the necessary information to be stored. If applicable, relationships between entities are established, such as linking pictures to documents or associating work time with specific tasks.

For server-side development, a backend server is set up using a server-side language such as PHP, Node.js. This server handles requests from the front-end interface and implements APIs or endpoints that allow interaction with the database. CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for each entity are also implemented in the server-side logic.
